### A Certosa Respectful Tour

This is the repository containing the design brief of <b>CeRTo project</b>, together with the final presentation and the prototypes.
The project's aim is to develop a Respectful Tour of the Certosa Monumental Cemetery (Bologna, Italy), a place full of masterpieces and of great historical importance.

### Prototypes
In the ***"Prototypes"*** folder are:
- Two Figma files, one related to the presentation of the product and the services and the other to the prototype of the application thought to be used from both inside and outside the Cemetery.
- A Twine protptype that aims at demonstrate what it would be to take part to the _in-loco_ experience at the Certosa Monumental Cemetery.


This project has been realized for the course _"Interaction media design"_ of the master's degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the UNiversity of Bologna.
